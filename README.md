First tries on the advenct-of-code puzzles 2018, in Python. Mostly done in Dec. 2018/ beginning 2019.

Code is messy/not-pretty, but I learned a lot by doing it. For some solutions I looked at other solutions cause I couldn't figure it out. For me I figured that to be okay since it should be a learning experience.
